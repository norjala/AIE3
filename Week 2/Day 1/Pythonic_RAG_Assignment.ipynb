            "2. Use meaningful variable names: When setting up your loop, use variable names that are descriptive and make it clear what the loop is doing.\n",

            "3. Avoid infinite loops: Make sure to include a condition for exiting the loop to prevent it from running indefinitely.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Keep the loop body concise: Aim to keep the code inside the loop as clean and simple as possible to improve readability and maintainability.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Test and debug: Before running your loop on a large dataset or complex problem, test it with smaller inputs to ensure it is working correctly. Debug any errors that arise.\n",
            "\n",
            "Remember, writing a loop is a skill that improves with practice. Keep experimenting and refining your loop-writing technique to become more proficient in handling different types of tasks.\n"
